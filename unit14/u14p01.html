       <p>Some of the amplifiers you built in A112 were able to power a small speaker and in one case you experimented with that. It was not very loud, likely not even as loud as your cell phone speaker. It would be difficult to fit the amplifier you built into your phone, even if we left out all the other stuff that your phone does. The development that paved the way for all the things your phone can now do, and prior to that the development of the personal computer, was the creation of integrated circuits. Some integrated circuits used for audio are shown in figure 1-1.</p>
       <p>An <span class="term">integrated circuit</span> takes a single piece of semiconductor material and builds complex circuits on it. These circuits are built in the manufacturing process, they can't be changed or repaired afterward like the circuits you have built on your breadboards. To give you an idea of how much circuitry they can fit onto an integrated circuit the processor in an iPhone 6, the Apple A8, contains 2,000,000,000 (two billion) transistors. The accompanying video gives an overview of the manufacturing process for integrated circuits, also known as chips or I.C.s</p>

       <h1>Why?</h1>
       <p>You have likely noticed that electronic devices keep getting smaller and smaller, that is certainly one benefit of integrated circuits. Another benefit is that as the I.C.s get smaller, so do the components that make them up and the space between those components. All of this means that the devices can work faster.</p>       
       <p>The largest benefit with the I.C.s with which we will be working, however, is that they are simply easier to use and build circuits around. The first integrated circuit we will be working with, for instance, contains two separate amplifier circuits each of which contains: 29 transistors, 2 diodes, 4 capacitors, and 16 resistors. We, however, only have 5 connections for all those components. The circuit also works, we don't have to worry about getting any of those 51 connected incorrectly. In other words, they are simply easier to use.</p>
       <h1>Why Not?</h1>    
       <p>So is there any reason to not use integrated circuits for everything? Modern  I.C. op-amps excel at having high speed and low distortion. They are extremely  powerful for their size. This is great for some applications, but there are  many involved with audio that prefer the sound of circuits built around  individual transistors, at least in some parts of the audio signal path. These are called <span class="term">discrete circuits</span> and are marketed as sounding better than I.C. based circuits.</p>
       <p>So do they? They certainly can sound better, but it is not true that every discrete circuit sounds better than every I.C. circuit.</p>
