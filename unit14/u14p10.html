        <p>In unit 8 we looked at power supplies. The circuits we  looked at were <strong>
        <term>linear power supplies</term>
       </strong> and were the only option for a long time. There is another type of power supply  called a <strong>
       <term>switch mode power supply</term>
       </strong>; these  now see widespread use in all areas of electronics. Though the audio industry  was slow to embrace them, they are now becoming common for audio use.</p>
       <p>The big difference between linear and switching power  supplies is efficiency. Linear power supplies waste a lot of energy. Switching  power supplies are far more efficient, wasting less energy. That not only makes  them use less electricity, but it also makes them physically smaller and less  heavy.</p>
       <p>
         <h1>The Old Way</h1>
       </p>
       <p><a href="../img/unit14/figure10-1.png" target="new"><img src="../img/unit14/figure10-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="235" class="image_border" ></a>Way back in unit 8  when voltage regulation was discussed, an I.C. version of a voltage regulator  was briefly mentioned. Since this was before Op-Amps or transistors it could  not be discussed in detail. These &quot;three-legged&quot; voltage regulators  (as shown in figure 10-1) are very common in electronics equipment. Â Because these are I.C.s we don&rsquo;t have to fully  understand their inner workings. It is important, however, to understand their  capabilities and recognize their limitations. It is also imperative that the  maximum ratings of these components be followed, with an additional safety  margin, when utilizing them in <br>
        circuits.</p>
       <p><a href="../img/unit14/figure 10-2.png" target="new"><img src="../img/unit14/figure 10-2.png" alt="" width="400" height="151" class="image_border" ></a>Figure 10-2 shows a  simplified schematic for one of these voltage regulators.<br>
The input voltage  can be reduced to provide a lower regulated voltage at the output. The regulator  will use some of the voltage, so there needs to be more at the input than the  desired output. The output voltage must be the same polarity as the input. For instance,  if you want a negative voltage output you must have a negative voltage input (<em>as  well as a negative voltage regulator</em>).</p>
       <ul type="disc">
         <li>The output       voltage is compared to a reference voltage by the op-amp.</li>
         <ul type="circle">
           <li>Remember        that the op-amp will output the difference between + and - inputs.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>The output of       the op-amp controls the Darlington pair transistors to set the output       voltage.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>This works very well  and was the way most power supplies were built prior to the year 2000. Since  then more and more electronic devices utilize switching regulators.</p>
       <h3>
         <h1>Let's save energy!</h1>
       </h3>
       <p>Modern electronic  devices are not only smaller but they are more efficient, less of the  electricity that they take in is wasted. One of the ways this is done is  through the use of&nbsp;<strong>switch mode power supplies</strong>&nbsp;(SMPS). I will  give an overview of the concept behind the switch mode power supply but not get  into great detail.<br>
         The switch mode  power supply concept can be a complete power supply or just a voltage  regulator. There are also components called DC-DC converters that utilize the  same concept. </p>
       <p><a href="../img/unit14/figure 10-3.png" target="new"><img src="../img/unit14/figure10-3.png" alt="" width="300" height="209" class="image_right" ></a>Let&rsquo;s take a  standard microphone preamplifier using I.Cs. In most cases it would require  three voltages: +15, -15, and +48. You can purchase a relatively inexpensive  +48V power supply, like the one shown in figure 13-17. From this we could use a  &quot;three-legged&quot; voltage regulator such as an LM317 to reduce that +48VDC&nbsp;to  +15VDC. That extra 33V, however, would be converted to heat and  (since we are not building a heater) be wasted. There is also no way to get  -15V using a simple I.C. voltage regulator.<br>
If we use a DC-DC  converter, however, we can input +48VDC and get +15VDC and  -15VDC&nbsp;out. The I.C. doesn&rsquo;t waste the extra voltage; instead  it simply takes what it needs. Switch mode regulators and power supplies can  have efficiencies of 90% or more. That means that only 10% of the energy is  wasted. In our I.C. example above that wasted 33V meant an efficiency of less  than 32% as it wasted 68% of the energy.</p>
       <h3>
         <h1>How it works</h1>
       </h3>
       <p>With a switch mode  regulator (or power supply) a transistor is used to switch the input DC on and  off. This is typically done with a MOSFET and a high frequency oscillator. This  oscillator should be operating above the range of human hearing and the sample  rate of digital audio converters. A pulse-width-modulated square wave is  created by the oscillator. The width of the &ldquo;on&rdquo; portion of the square wave  determines how much of the voltage gets converted. (figure 13-18)</p>
       <ul type="disc">
         <li>If the       transistor is on for shorter amount of time the output voltage will be       lower. (figure 13-19)</li>
         <li>The less time       the transistor is turned on, the less energy the circuit uses.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Figure 13-17 and 13-18  show simplified schematics to give an idea of how these circuits work. In these  figures we simply have a function generator turning the FET on and off. In a  real circuit, the FET would be controlled by a circuit that was measuring the  output voltage and comparing that to a reference.</p>
