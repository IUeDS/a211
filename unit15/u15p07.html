       <h1>Channel Power!</h1>
       <p>We are going to investigate the circuit analysis process by looking at a channel strip circuit. This circuit was designed for this class to illustrate some new circuit ideas as well as the analysis process. I recommend printing out a paper copy of the schematic that you can makes notes on and refer to. This schematic is available <a href="../media/unit15/A211ChanStrip_schematic.pdf" target="new">here</a>.</p>
       <div class="image_right"><a href="../img/unit15/ChanStrip_Power.png" target="new"><img src="../img/unit15/ChanStrip_Power.png" alt="Channel strip power supply schematic" width="400" height="143" class="image_border"></a></div>
       <p>We will begin with the power supply section of the circuit shown in figure 7-1. But first...............</p>
       <div class="line_break"></div>
       <h1>The Old Way</h1>
       <div class="image_right"> <img src="../../A112/img/unit08/figure7-2.png"  alt="Voltage regulator" width="200" height="164" class="image_border"/> </div>
       <p>Way back in Unit 8 when voltage regulation was discussed an I.C. version of a voltage regulator was briefly mentioned. Since this was before OpAmps or transistors it could not be discussed in detail. These "three-legged" voltage regulators (as shown in figure 7-2) are very common in electronics, however and are worth understanding. Because they are I.C.s we do not need to know more than how to connect them and what they do, however, understanding how they work will help understand the benefits of the I.C. we are using in the channel strip power supply.</p>
       <div class="image_left"><a href="../img/unit15/Vreg_IC.png" target="new"><img src="../img/unit15/Vreg_IC.png" alt="Voltage regulator schematic" width="400" height="198" class="image_border"></a></div>
       <p>Figure 7-3 shows a simplified schematic for one of these voltage regulators.
    
       
       
        <p>The input voltage can be reduced to provide a lower regulated voltage at the output. The transistor will use need some of the voltage so there needs to be more at the input than the desired output. The output voltage must be the same polarity as the input. For instance if you want a negative voltage output you must have a negative voltage input (<em>as well as a negative voltage regulator</em>).        
        <ul>
          <li>The output voltage is compared to a reference voltage by the op-amp.
            <ul>
              <li>remember that the OpAmps will output the difference between + and - inputs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The output of the OpAmps controls the Darlington pair transistors to set the output voltage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This works very well and was the way most power supplies were built prior to the year 2000. Since then more and more electronic devices utilize a new device like the one we use in our channel strip.</p>
        <div class="line_break"></div>
        <h1>Let's save energy!</h1>
        <p>Modern electronic devices are not only smaller but they are more efficient, els of the electricity that they take in is wasted. On of the ways this is done is through the use of <span class="term">switch mode power supplies</span> (SMPS). I will give an overview of the concept behind the switch mode power supply but not get in great detail.         
        <p>In our channel strip circuit we are using a DC-DC converter (DC to DC converter). This uses the same concept as a switch mode power supply but as a switch mode voltage regulator.        
        <div class="image_left"><img src="../img/unit15/wallwart.jpg" alt="Wall wart power supplies" width="200" height="216" class="image_border"></div>
        <p>Our channel strip circuit needs three voltages: +15, -15, and +48. We start with a 48V<sub>DC</sub> external power supply (aka Wall Wart, see image 7-4). From this we could use a 15V &quot;three-legged&quot; voltage regulator such as an LM7815 to reduce that +48V<sub>DC</sub> to +15V<sub>DC</sub>. That extra 33V, however, would be converted to heat and (since we are not building a heater) be wasted. There is also no way to get -15V using a simple I.C. voltage regulator.        
        <p>With our DC-DC converter, however, we can input +48VDC and get +15V<sub>DC</sub> and -15V<sub>DC</sub> out. The I.C. doesn't waste the extra voltage, instead it simply takes what it needs. Switch mode regulators and power supplies can have efficiencies of 90% or more. that means that only 10% of the energy is wasted. In our I.C. example above that wasted 33V meant an efficiency of under 32% while wasting 68% of the energy.        
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>With a switch mode regulator (or power supply) a transistor is used to switch the input DC on and off. This is typically done with a MOSFET and really fast (10-100kHz). 
                   
        This creates a pulse (square wave). Control circuitry determines how long the circuit is turned on.
        <ul>
          <li>If the transistor is on for longer amount of time the output voltage will be higher. (figure 7-5)</li>
          <li>If the transistor is on for shorter amount of time the output voltage will be lower. (figure 7-6)</li>
          <li>The less time the transistor is on, the less energy the circuit uses.</li>
        </ul>
