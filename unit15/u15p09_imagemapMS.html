       <h1>And now.....our circuit</h1>
       <p>Let's take a look at our microphone preamplifier circuit (shown in figure 9-1) and use the circuit analysis method form the previous pages in this unit. We will start at the left side of the schematic and move right. I will talk how I arrive at each component function as well as defining the function. I will go through different methods of investigating the function from different components so that you can see the options.</p>

       <h2>Let's start at the input. </h2>
       <p>Our input is at J1. J in a schematic refers to a jack for connecting a plug. In this case it could be the XLR connector or a connector between the printed circuit board and the XLR. It has three pins just like an XLR and the numbering is the same.
       An image of both male and female XLR connectors is shown in figure 9-2.

       <li><strong>Pin 1 = Ground</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Pin 2 = Hot</strong></li>

        <em>***note that pins 2 and 3 can be reversed depending on the equipment manufacturer***</em><br>
		</ul>
	   <h1>Moving to the right.......</h1>
       <div class="line_break"></div>
       <p>With balanced circuits we often see the components in the same position for both hot and cold. In fact it is very important that these two paths be as similar as possible. In most cases that means that once you have defined the function of a component on either hot or cold, then you have defined it for the other path as well.       
       <h1 id="c101">C101,C102, and C103</h1>      
       <p>The first components we come to are C101 and C102, both of which are 470pF and C103 which is 47pF.</p>

       <h2>How we figure it out.</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>These are capacitors, we start with what we know about capacitors:         
             <ul>
               <li>Capacitors block DC and allow AC to pass.</li>
               <li>Capacitors allow high frequencies to pass easier than low.</li>
               <li>Capacitive reactance <span class="equation">$x_{c} = \frac {1}{2\pi FC} $ </span></li>        
               <li>Series capacitor creates a high pass filter.</li>     
               <li>Parallel capacitor creates a low pass filter.</li>                </ul>
         <li>How are these capacitors connected?</li>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>C101 &amp; C102</strong>: They connect hot and cold together going through both C101 and C102. This path would allow high frequencies to go from hot to cold. Since hot and cold are opposite polarity the signals would cancel out. This would create a low pass filter, cutting  frequencies that would easily pass through the 470pF capacitors.</li>
                <li><strong>C103:</strong> This capacitor connects both Hot and Cold to chassis GND through C101 or C102. Again this creates a low pass filter, cutting  frequencies that would easily pass through the 470pF and 47pF capacitors.</li>
                </ul>
             <li>What else can we determine?
             <ul>
             As a rule (remember this from unit 13?) capacitors with a value in pF will pass frequencies above audio. This makes sense in this case because it means that frequencies above audio, that we don't care about, are canceled before they are amplified.
             </ul></li></li></ol>

       <h1 id="sw101">SW101, R101, R102, R104, and C100</h1>
       <p>Taking a look up from C101 and C102 we see SW101 and the components connected to it. Even though it is not labeled we can see that SW101 either connects or dis-connects +48V from Hot and Cold. So this is the phantom power switch.
       <div class="line_break"></div>
        <h2>Component by component.</h2>
        <ul>
        <li style="margin: 10px"><strong>SW101: </strong>When this switch is in the position drawn currently on the schematic +48V is connected to R101 and from there to R102 and R104. As stated above this determines if +48V is sent to Hot and Cold or not. When the switch is down, instead of voltage connecting to R102 and R104 they connect to chassis GND. <br>
         Why connect to chassis GND when +48V is turned off?<br>
        This is one of those situations when we want to separate AC and DC in our thinking. For AC (audio) that +48V connection represents a short to GND. <em>Why is that?</em> Think about the DC power supplies we studied in unit 8, what was typically the last component in the circuit?
<div class="image_right"><img src="../../A112/img/unit08/figure6-1.png" alt="" width="250" height="81" class="image_border"></div>
There was always a capacitor in parallel with the output. These will be large value capacitors to get rid of ripple (fluctuations in the DC). That means they have a very low reactance for audio frequencies and act like a short circuit to ground, for audio frequencies. By connecting R102 and R104 to GND when +48V is not connected, the circuit looks the same to audio frequencies whether +48V is turned on or off.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px"><strong>R101: </strong>With R101 we have a small resistance of 200Ω in series with the +48V. This resistor provides isolation between multiple channels using the same +48V supply. Since there is only one channel connected to this 48V supply this component could have been left off. It was included as an example of a typical circuit.</li>
<li style="margin: 10px"><strong>R102 &amp; R104: </strong>We need to send the same DC voltage (+48) to both the Hot and Cold audio paths. 
  <div class="question_and_answer_full">
	<div class="question_button">
    	<div class="question_button_header">If we connect both the Hot and Cold paths directly to R101 what would happen?<br>
        	<span class="question_button_subheader">(click to reveal answer)</span></div></div>
         <div class="revealed_answer">
         	<div class="revealed_answer_header_wide_lower text-align-left">We would be connecting the Hot and Cold audio paths to the same point.<br>
So we would be connecting them together.<br>
       	     Since they have opposite polarity signals they would cancel out and we would get <strong>NO AUDIO</strong>!<br> Without audio, the phantom +48V is not very useful.</div></div></div>
            So we need something to separate the hot and cold audio paths while still allowing the +48V to connect them. R102 and R104 serve that function.
            <p><em>Wait!, Why are they 6.8kΩ?</em><br>
            It's all about protecting the circuit. If the mic input were shorted. This is something that happens, often while plugging in a connector. If that were to happen, then R102 & R104 (in parallel as far as the +48V is concerned) would need to drop the entire 48V.</p>
            <p>So we have 2 resistors in parallel that need to drop 48V. We have same value resistor for Hot and Cold so our total resistance (because they are in parallel) will be half of each resistor, so 3.4kΩ. We know that the +48V supply needs to be able to supply at least 14mA of current.</p>
            <p>Our buddy Ohm's law tells us: $48V = 14mA * R$ which means $R = 
        3.429kΩ$<br>
        Rounded to the closest standard resistor value we get 3.4kΩ.</li>
            <li><strong>C100:</strong> C100 is a capacitor connected from a DC voltage to GND. The DC cannot pass through it. One typical mistake beginners make when analyzing a circuit would be to say that C100 is blocking the DC from going to GND. The fault with that idea is that <em>if C100 were not there</em> then the DC would have no path to GND so the capacitor would not have that function. Remember that capacitors block DC <em>while</em> allowing AC to pass. In this case it sends any AC (ripple, noise, or audio) to GND. This will get rid of any noise added as the +48V travels through the wiring as well as audio added from other preamp channels using this same +48V supply.</li>
        </ul>            
            <div class="basicconcept">
              <div class="basicconcept_header">The function of SW101,R101, R102,  R104, and C100</div>

         <strong>R102</strong> and <strong>R104</strong> are there to supply +48V to the Hot and Cold audio paths without shorting them. Their value is set so that, if they are shorted together, only 14mA of current is drawn from the +48V supply.<br>

         <p>R103 connects between Hot and Cold. What the microphone "sees" as the input impedance when it sends signal to the preamplifier is the impedance between Hot and Cold. Being connected between Hot and Cold, R103 sets this imput impedance. The actual input impedance is R103 in parallel with everthing to the right of it, including the I.C. input impedance. The I.C. input impedance we can find from the datasheet and it is over 1MΩ; C104/C105 and R105/R106 only increase that alredy large number. The 2.7kΩ of R103 in parallel wtih 1MΩ will be made slightly smaller but, effectively the input impedance is 2.7kΩ.</p>

             <ul>
               <li> <strong>D101-D104 </strong>limit the spikes created when +48V is turned ON (+48 spike) or OFF (-48V spike) by limiting the peak to roughly +/-15.5V.<br>
                 They would also limit very large line level signals if connected to the Mic input.
               </li>
               <li><strong>R105 </strong>&amp;<strong> R106 </strong>are there as current limiting resistors to reduce current when those spikes are being limited.</li>
